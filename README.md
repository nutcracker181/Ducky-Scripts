# DUCKY SCRIPTS

A USB Rubber Ducky script is a series of keystrokes encoded in a text file, designed to be executed automatically when the USB Rubber Ducky device is plugged into a computer. The USB Rubber Ducky is a programmable USB device that emulates a keyboard, allowing it to inject pre-programmed keystrokes at high speed.

Uses:

* Penetration Testing:

    Used by security professionals to simulate attacks by injecting commands that compromise a system.
* Automation:

    Automate repetitive tasks by quickly executing commands or opening specific programs.
* Social Engineering:

    Perform phishing attacks or deploy malware by simulating user interactions.
* Credential Harvesting:

    Extract stored passwords, Wi-Fi credentials, or other sensitive data from a target system.


Its effectiveness relies on the assumption that the target device will recognize it as a standard keyboard, making it a powerful tool in both ethical hacking and malicious activities.
